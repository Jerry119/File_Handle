# File_Handle

The assignment is intended to allow user upload, download and delete files.
I used flask API to accompish the purposes.
The program has to be run on the command line.
Use command '$ virtualenv venv' and 'FLASK_APP=main.py flask run' to start running the program.
Assign an absolute path of the folder you want to store the file to UPLOAD_FOLDER in main.py.
